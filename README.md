# Summary

[I have a new home]: https://redbirdrants.com/

My name is Parker Matthews. I'm originally from Columbus, Ohio, but moved to southern Indiana during my elementary years. I attended Lynnville Elementary until 6th grade, and then I went to Tecumseh Jr/Sr High School. In my personal life, I own my own LLC in the state of Indiana as a sole proprietor. Regarding my education, after attending Southern Indiana Career & Technical Center, I plan to enroll at the University of Southern Indiana for either CIS or CS for four or more years. After completing my education, I intend to move out of the Southern Indiana area and relocate to the west, although I am not sure about the exact location yet. Thanks for taking the time to read.
